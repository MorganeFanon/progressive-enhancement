                  bad, but a potential in

            <p><b>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that
                  gaz
                  opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
                  no such
                  thing as an
                  issue.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
               Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
               reality
               changes.That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If
               we mis
               translate themessage, ourreality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
               way.
               Therefore, if we canchange reality that much, everything’s fake. </p>
            <br>
            <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out
               ofthat grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
               the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you
               can
               make your
               world, it’s thatyou passively do it anyway.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
               around to commiserate.They said, <br>
            <div class="quoteV"><i>
                  <p>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                     unfortunate.”
               </i></p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The farmer said,
            <div class="quoteF">
               <p><i>“Is it <span class="good"></span>good
                     </span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</i></p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came
               back
               and said,
            <div class="quoteV"><p><i>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</i>
            </p></div>
            <br>
            <p>The farmer again said,
            <div class="quoteF">
               <p><i>“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</i></p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
               his
               leg. The neighbors then said,
            <div class="quoteV">
               <p><i>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</i></p>
            </div>
            <P> and the farmer responded,</P>
            <div class="quoteF">
               <p><i>“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't
                     know.”</i>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
               his son
               because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <div class="quoteV">
               <p><i>“Isn’t that great!”</i></p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Again, he said
            <div class="quoteF" ,>
               <p><i>“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</i></p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <blockquote id="quote">
               <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible

            <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are
